Good day! You may use this guide if needed.

- To launch the system, simply double click the file
- To open the developer version, hold the 'shift' button on your keyboard while opening the file
- To view the VBA program codes (for UI design and added functionality), click any module on the "Module" section found at the bottom of the navigation panel
- Several SQL functions are encrypted in the forms as VBA codes.
- Username & Password = admin

NOTE: some revisions in the System UI cannot be viewed in the .accdb file, but can instead be found on the documentation paper


Thank you so much, Stay safe!
